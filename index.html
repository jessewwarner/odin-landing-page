            <div class="content">
                <p>Ragnarök is the catastrophic and apocalyptic event in Norse mythology that marks the end of the world and the twilight of the gods. Foretold in ancient Norse prophecies, it represents a cataclysmic series of events that lead to the utter destruction of the existing cosmos. During Ragnarök, major figures like Odin, Thor, Loki, and many others are fated to die in epic battles and natural disasters. The world itself undergoes upheaval, with the land sinking into the sea, the sun and moon losing their light, and chaos reigning supreme.</p>
                <p>However, Ragnarök also carries elements of renewal and rebirth. After the devastation, a new world emerges from the ashes, with a surviving pair of humans who will repopulate the earth and surviving gods who gather to rebuild. This cyclical theme in Norse mythology underscores the inevitability of fate and the idea that even the gods are not immune to the forces of destiny, making Ragnarök a powerful and enduring symbol of cosmic upheaval and transformation.</p>
