# odin-landing-page
Landing page project for The Odin Project

This project is creating an entire web page from scratch. It requires
the use of all HTML and CSS taught throughout the project up to this
point.

The skills shown by successfully completing this project are HTML, CSS,
and Git. The project will show that I have learned the fundamental
knowledge necessary to make a web page that is aesthetically pleasing
and use Git to manage version control of the project.
